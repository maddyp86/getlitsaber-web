# Litsaber Website Rebuild — Working Memory

A live log of the build, decisions made, and story beats captured along the way. Use this as the source for content posts and interview narratives. Updated phase by phase.

---

## Project at a Glance

**What:** Replatform `getlitsaber.com` from WordPress/Avada to a modern Next.js storefront on Shopify, instrumented with a production AI agent that runs weekly conversion analysis and proposes A/B tests.

**Why now:** The current WordPress/Avada site was an agency build that prioritized output over outcomes. Conversion data didn't support the spec-sheet narrative the site led with. The rebuild does two things at once: (1) reposition Litsaber from "vape battery" to "festival accessory that happens to hit 510 carts," and (2) replace a static marketing site with a learning system that compounds.

**Repositioning thesis (locked):**
> Litsaber is a festival accessory that happens to hit 510 carts — not a vape battery with an LED. Its meant for buyers who self-identify by what's visible at the night, not by what's hidden in their pocket. Every product, copy, design, and channel decision should foreground visibility, lifestyle, and the engineered hardware that makes it credible — and should refuse any framing that competes Litsaber on discretion, commodity vape specs, or low price.

## Tool Stack & Rationale

| Phase | Tool | Why this tool |
|------|------|---------------|
| Design | Figma | Source of truth for visual + messaging decisions |
| Scaffold | Bolt | Fastest path from Figma to working Next.js code |
| Build & integrate | Claude Code | Owns whole repo, plans multi-file changes, runs commands — right mode for integration work |
| Commerce | Shopify Storefront API | Hosted checkout removes a class of compliance + payment risk (Stripe is off-limits for vape) |
| Analytics | PostHog + Vercel Analytics | Free tier, feature flags, performance — covers product + perf |
| Data surface | Supabase | Clean SQL surface the production agent can query directly |
| Orchestration | n8n | Existing fluency; better story than custom Python service |
| Agent reasoning | Claude API (tools) | Lets the agent query the database for follow-ups |

**The PM principle here:** match the tool to the job per phase. No single tool for the whole build. The narrative beat for interviews is *tool-fit reasoning*, not *tool fluency*.

---

## Workflow Decisions (locked)

- **GitHub is the single source of truth.** Code, context docs, working memory all live in the repo. Nothing in Notion or a side Google Doc.
- **Git workflow:** Direct push to `main` for Phase 1 (docs only). Switch to feature branches + self-merged PRs + Vercel preview deploys from Phase 2 forward.
- **`CLAUDE.md` at root.** Claude Code reads it automatically every session.
- **ADRs in `/docs/decisions/`.** Significant architecture calls get one markdown file each.
- **Conventional Commits.**
- **Secrets hygiene:** `.env.example` committed, `.env.local` gitignored, real values in Vercel dashboard.
- **Skipped for now:** pre-commit hooks, Dependabot, automated tests.
- **Hosting: Vercel.** Locked. Made by the Next.js team, ships features for Next.js first, tightest fit for the framework. Hobby tier free at launch. Pro tier ($20/mo) likely 6+ months in driven by production agent function time.
- **Domain registrar:** Namecheap (existing). Domain getlitsaber.com stays at Namecheap. DNS A/CNAME records will be pointed at Vercel during Phase 6/7 launch cutover. No registrar migration.
- **Migration cutover:** Build the new site on Vercel under its default preview URL. Existing WordPress/Avada site continues serving getlitsaber.com until the new build is verified. DNS flip is the actual launch moment. 1–2 week parallel period for rollback safety. Logged for Phase 7.

## Build Log

### Phase 1 — Design Tokens & Repo Foundation ✅

**Goal:** Give Bolt and Claude Code structured context to work from, so the codebase reflects Figma decisions and brand strategy from day one.

**Deliverables**
- [x] `tokens.json` — design tokens
- [x] `BRAND.md` — voice, audience, repositioning thesis
- [x] `COMPONENTS.md` — initial component inventory pulled from homepage Figma
- [x] `CLAUDE.md` — persistent operational context for the agent
- [x] `README.md` — human-facing project entry point
- [x] `.gitignore` and `.env.example`
- [x] `docs/decisions/001-tool-stack-and-phasing.md`
- [x] GitHub repo init with first commit

**Decisions logged in Phase 1**
1. **Repositioning thesis locked** — every downstream decision routes through it.
2. **Font stack is five fonts:** Stellar (display), Monoton (accent), Orbitron (sub-headings), Inter (body), Space Mono (labels). Stellar is paid-licensed and self-hosted via `next/font/local`.
3. **Tokens are reverse-engineered, not exported.** Figma file had no defined variables/styles. We defined the token system ourselves.
4. **MSRP is $59.99**, locked.
5. **GitHub-first context architecture** — strategy docs live in the repo, not in a side doc.
6. **Mobile derived from desktop, in Phase 3, not Phase 2.** (Updated in Phase 1.5 — mobile Figma frames now exist; this decision is reversed.)

---

### Phase 1.5 — Scope Expansion & Mobile/Desktop Reconciliation ✅

**Goal:** Pull the rest of the design context (mobile frames, additional pages, cart system, modals) before kicking off Phase 2.

**What happened**
- User built out the full mobile UI in Figma between Phase 1 close and Phase 2 start
- Pulled 14+ frames across Mobile and Desktop Figma pages via the Figma MCP integration
- Hit a Starter-tier rate limit mid-pull; user upgraded to Professional to unblock
- Several frames timed out (Policies page in particular) — handled by treating as known templated pattern rather than blocking on a full pull
- Final inventory: 8 pages, 2 modals, full cart system, full reviews subsystem, ~78 components total

**Deliverables**
- [x] `tokens.json` — updated with cart drawer dimensions, modal widths, z-index layer system, component sizing tokens
- [x] `BRAND.md` — MSRP corrected to $59.99, five-font system noted, social proof stats locked
- [x] `COMPONENTS.md` — fully rewritten covering all 8 pages + modals + cart + reviews subsystem
- [x] `CLAUDE.md` — added age gate compliance rules, reviews provider note, expanded commerce constraints (MOQ 5, 4-tier wholesale)
- [x] `docs/decisions/002-scope-expansion-eight-page-site.md` — ADR documenting the scope change

**Decisions logged in Phase 1.5**
1. **Site map is 8 pages, not 1.** Homepage + PDP + Engineering + Wholesale + About + Activate + Contact + Policies (5 sub-pages).
2. **Wholesale MOQ is 5** (locked). 80 case pack. 4 tiers: Initiate / Knight / Archon / Legend.
3. **"TEN WAYS TO BE SEEN"** is canonical, not "TWELVE." Hero spec pill reads "10 Colors."
4. **Age Gate is compliance-critical** — must sit at top z-index, required for vape category. Behavior policy (cookie duration, etc.) deferred to Phase 2.
5. **Reviews subsystem on PDP is its own complete system** — rating summary, distribution chart, AI summary, photo carousel, search, filter chips, paginated review cards. Provider undecided; build with mock data in Phase 2, integrate in Phase 4.
6. **PDP long-form copy needs rewrite.** Current Figma copy ("Ignite your night... world's first... glow-up accessory") violates BRAND.md voice rules.
7. **Phase 2 timeline extended** from 5–7 days to 10–14 days due to scope expansion. Total project timeline now ~6–7 weeks.
8. **Phase 2 build order locked:** Foundation → Homepage → PDP → Cart → Wholesale + About → Engineering + Activate → Contact + Policies.
9. **Mobile is no longer derived in Phase 3.** User built mobile Figma frames; mobile gets scaffolded in Phase 2 alongside desktop. (Reverses Phase 1 decision.)

**Real inconsistencies surfaced and resolved**
- "TEN WAYS" vs "TWELVE WAYS" → TEN (Figma + spec pill updated)
- Charge time conflict (20 mins vs 75 mins) → 75 mins fixed in Figma
- 3.7v voltage label → fixed in Figma
- Duplicate spec grid rows → fixed in Figma
- Wholesale MOQ inconsistency (25 vs 5) → 5 (Figma + COMPONENTS.md updated)
- Wholesale case pack inconsistency (80 vs 100) → 80 (Figma)
- Wholesale tier count (9 vs 4 vs 6) → 4 tiers (Figma + checklist updated)
- "RETAILER MARGING" typo → fixed
- Spec pill "1.5yr Power settings" mislabel → fixed
- Hero "12 Colors" → "10 Colors" (fixed)

**Drift items flagged but not yet resolved**
- Desktop homepage Wholesale CTA still reads "MOQ 25 · 100+" (needs Figma update)
- Desktop footer missing Social icons + "DESIGNED IN LA | ASSEMBLED IN ASIA" (in mobile, not desktop)
- "$59.00" typo in cart drawer (should be $59.99)
- "REVIEWINFRA" placeholder needs real provider name
- "LITSABER OG +" PDP title — is the `+` intentional?
- 2-Pack "SAVE $20" badge math is $19.99 — round up or keep?
- FAQ Contact page mentions competitor "Danksaber" by name — keep, reframe, or remove?
- Empty Section 6 (1440×1820) on desktop homepage between FAQs and Reviews
- FAQ #3 placeholder copy on homepage ("How long does the battery last?")
- Contact FAQ answers are mostly boilerplate placeholder — need real copy pre-launch

**Outreach materials to reconcile post-launch (separate from web build)**
- `Litsaber_Wholesale_Pricing_2026.pdf` shows 9 tiers + MOQ 25; needs rewrite to 4 tiers + MOQ 5
- `Litsaber_Business_Competence_Cheat_Sheet.pdf` shows 31 LEDs + 10–12 colors; needs update to 41 LEDs + 10 colors

**Pre-Phase-2 decisions locked (closeout)**
1. **Reviews provider: ReviewInfra** (https://reviewinfra.dev). Script-tag widget integration model. Phase 4 default approach: Path A (use widget as-is). Stretch: Path B (data API, render our own UI) pending confirmation from ReviewInfra that a read API exists. Action item: email ReviewInfra to confirm.
2. **AI Summary: open.** ReviewInfra docs don't advertise an AI summary feature. Three options: (a) confirm built-in support with ReviewInfra, (b) build a custom Claude API endpoint that synthesizes reviews server-side and caches, (c) skip the `<AISummaryCard />` for v1. Decision deferred to post-ReviewInfra-conversation.
3. **Bundle SKU: quantity discount on single SKU.** 2-Pack is not a separate Shopify product. Cart adds 2× the single SKU + applies the discount.
4. **PDP long-form copy: approved for rewrite.** Current Figma copy ("Ignite your night... world's first... glow-up accessory") to be replaced with copy matching BRAND.md voice during Phase 2 scaffold. Claude Code will draft and flag for review before commit.
5. **Age gate: locked.** First-visit cookie (`litsaber_age_verified`), 30-day duration, hard wall, EXIT → google.com. Env vars committed in `.env.example`.

**Pre-Phase-2 decisions still open (non-blocking)**

None. Phase 2 unblocked.

**Story beats captured (Phase 1.5)**

| # | Beat | Tag |
|---|------|-----|
| 6 | "Scope expanded ~5x between Phase 1 spec and Phase 2 kickoff. 1 page became 8. I didn't push back on the scope. I re-scoped the timeline and the build order — and wrote an ADR explaining why before touching the next prompt. Re-planning is the senior signal; pretending the plan still fits isn't." | `pm-discipline` |
| 7 | "Hit a Figma MCP rate limit mid-pull. Didn't argue with it — picked the recovery path that preserved the discipline (extract spec before scaffold) without blocking. User upgraded mid-conversation; I picked the next-highest-leverage frame to pull rather than restarting." | `tool-choice`, `pm-discipline` |
| 8 | "Pulled the Figma file and surfaced 11 real cross-document inconsistencies — MOQ, case pack, tier count, voltage labels, color count, copy duplicates. None of them are bugs in code. They're inconsistencies in the SPEC. Catching them before Bolt sees them prevents an entire class of rework." | `discovery`, `pm-discipline` |
| 9 | "The Activate page is the secret weapon. Post-purchase onboarding most DTC brands skip — designed to reduce support tickets and reinforce the engineering thesis. Sticky chip nav, 8 functional sections, inline demo videos, QR-scan-from-box entry detection. Shipping in Phase 2, not deferred to v2." | `discovery` |
| 10 | "The PDP reviews section turned out to be a full subsystem — not a card list. Rating summary, distribution chart, AI-summary card, photo carousel, search, filter chips, paginated cards. Identifying it as a subsystem rather than a single component changes the Phase 4 provider decision from cosmetic to structural." | `discovery`, `integration-depth` |
| 11 | "Figma's PDP description copy was AI-toned ('Ignite your night... world's first... glow-up accessory'). It violated every rule in BRAND.md. Caught it because the voice rules were written down and load on every Claude Code session — the discipline does the work I'd otherwise have to do manually." | `pm-discipline`, `ai-augmented-build` |
| 12 | "Reviews provider was ReviewInfra — a small script-tag product, not a Yotpo/Stamped-scale platform. The integration model forces a real Phase 4 decision: ship their widget as-is and lose brand control on the PDP, or build a custom UI against their data API (if it exists). I logged it as Path A vs Path B in CLAUDE.md and made the email-to-ReviewInfra an explicit action item rather than guessing." | `tool-choice`, `integration-depth` |
| 13 | "Hosting choice came up mid-build. Default temptation is to pick whatever's familiar. I picked Vercel for a specific reason: it's made by the Next.js team, ships framework features first, and its serverless functions are the natural home for the Phase 6 production agent. Netlify would have worked — Vercel wins on tool-fit, not marketing. The domain stays at Namecheap. Registrar migration is a different decision and there's no reason to do it." | `tool-choice`, `pm-discipline` |

### Phase 2 — Foundation Complete (2026-05-20) ✅

**Goal:** Foundation phase — layout shell, global components, page stubs, token system.

**Deliverables**
- [x] Next.js 14, App Router, TypeScript strict mode, Tailwind CSS
- [x] `tailwind.config.ts` — all tokens from `tokens.json` mapped to named utilities (colors, fonts, spacing, radii, shadows, z-index, etc.)
- [x] `lib/fonts.ts` — Monoton, Orbitron, Inter, Space Mono via `next/font/google`; Stellar placeholder via CSS variable with system fallback, commented localFont block ready for when font file arrives
- [x] `app/globals.css` — Tailwind directives, Stellar placeholder var, scroll-lock class
- [x] `app/layout.tsx` — root layout with font variables, metadata, `<AgeGateModal />`, `<Navbar />`, `{children}`, `<Footer />` in order
- [x] `components/layout/Navbar.tsx` — sticky, transparent over hero, solid black on scroll; logo left, nav links center, user+cart icons right; hamburger mobile trigger
- [x] `components/layout/MobileNavDrawer.tsx` — full-screen drawer, 5 nav items with submenu indicators, expandable Quick Links, footer CTA + login link, scroll lock, focus management, Escape key close
- [x] `components/layout/Footer.tsx` — logo+tagline, social icons (Instagram, YouTube, TikTok), "DESIGNED IN LA" tagline on both mobile and desktop (drift resolved), 3 nav columns, compliance disclaimer, policy links, payment strip
- [x] `components/layout/AgeGateModal.tsx` — hard wall, cookie read on mount, 30-day max-age on confirm, EXIT link to google.com, reads all config from env vars
- [x] 14 page stubs (/, /shop/litsaber-og, /the-tech, /wholesale, /about, /activate, /contact, /cart, /policies/refunds, /policies/warranty, /policies/shipping, /policies/terms, /policies/privacy) — each with stub content and page-level metadata
- [x] Build passes clean — `next build` produces 14 static routes, no type errors

**Decisions made in this phase**

1. **Bolt bypassed for foundation.** Bolt was in the Phase 2 plan for scaffold, but Claude Code built the foundation layer directly. Reason: the token system, compliance constraints (age gate), and component spec were precise enough that Bolt's ~70% fidelity would have required a full audit pass anyway. Direct build is faster for components with locked specs.
2. **Stellar font uses CSS variable placeholder.** `next/font/local` requires the font file to exist at build time. Since Stellar.woff2 hasn't been added yet (paid license), the lib/fonts.ts has the `localFont` block commented out with clear instructions. The CSS variable `--font-stellar` falls back to "Arial Black" / Impact / system-ui. When the file arrives, drop it at `public/fonts/Stellar.woff2`, uncomment the localFont block, and remove the CSS variable override in globals.css.
3. **Footer drift resolved.** COMPONENTS.md flagged that the desktop footer was missing social icons and "DESIGNED IN LA" tagline (they existed on mobile only). Both are now on both breakpoints from the start — no deferred reconciliation needed.
4. **js-cookie removed.** Age gate uses `document.cookie` directly rather than introducing a dependency. Simpler, no bundle cost, sufficient for a single compliance cookie.

**Story beats (Phase 2 foundation)**

| # | Beat | Tag |
|---|------|-----|
| 13 | "Built the foundation layer directly instead of waiting for Bolt. The token system was precise, the age gate behavior was locked, and the component spec was detailed enough that a 70%-fidelity scaffold would have needed a full rewrite. Skipping a step isn't cutting corners when the step was designed for a different level of spec ambiguity." | `pm-discipline`, `tool-choice` |
| 14 | "The Stellar font placeholder pattern — commenting out the `localFont` block with exact instructions for when the file arrives — is a small thing that prevents a class of 'why doesn't the font look right' confusion later. The placeholder communicates intent; Arial Black communicates absence." | `ai-augmented-build` |
| 15 | "Caught the desktop footer drift before Phase 3 even started. Social icons and 'DESIGNED IN LA' are on both breakpoints in the first commit. One less thing to reconcile." | `pm-discipline` |

### Phase 2 continued — Homepage, PDP, Cart, etc. (pending)

**Goal:** Build all 8 page content layers.

**Sequencing (locked in ADR-002):**
1. Foundation — DONE (see above)
2. Homepage — All 11 narrative sections in scroll order
3. PDP — Product info, styles/bundles, mock data only. Reviews subsystem with seed data.
4. Cart — Drawer + page + line items + promo code (mock state, no real Shopify yet)
5. Wholesale + About — Lower-risk pages
6. Engineering + Activate — Higher complexity (kinetic animation, sticky chip nav)
7. Contact + Policies — Templated, fastest to ship

**Pre-Phase-2 decisions still pending** — see Phase 1.5 entry above.

---

### Phase 2 — Scaffold with Bolt (in progress)

**Goal:** Generate the visual layer of all 8 pages + cart UI + modals in Next.js 14, exported to GitHub at ~70% fidelity.

**Sequencing (locked in ADR-002):**
1. Foundation — Layout shell, Navbar, Footer, mobile drawer, age gate modal ✅
2. Homepage — All 11 narrative sections in scroll order
3. PDP — Product info, styles/bundles, mock data only. Reviews subsystem with seed data.
4. Cart — Drawer + page + line items + promo code (mock state, no real Shopify yet)
5. Wholesale + About — Lower-risk pages
6. Engineering + Activate — Higher complexity (kinetic animation, sticky chip nav)
7. Contact + Policies — Templated, fastest to ship

#### Phase 2 — Step 1: Foundation ✅

**Bolt output audited.** Build passes, preview works, all 13 routes render. Quality of token integration in `tailwind.config.ts` is gold-standard — every value imports from `tokens.json`, no inline hex anywhere. Accessibility on the modal/drawer is genuinely good (scroll lock, focus management, Escape close, full ARIA labeling). Footer drift from Phase 1.5 resolved — socials + "DESIGNED IN LA" present on both mobile and desktop.

**Three problems caught in audit (fix before Vercel connect):**
1. **Netlify leak.** Bolt installed `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` and created `netlify.toml` despite the Vercel decision being locked in CLAUDE.md. Cleanup prompt issued to Bolt.
2. **Dotfile damage in zip roundtrip.** When repo was downloaded as ZIP for audit, `.gitignore` and `.env.example` lost their leading dots, and a second `.gitignore` stub (2 lines, generic) appeared from Bolt's scaffold. Needs verification on github.com directly.
3. **Bolt claimed it updated working-memory.md but didn't.** Phase 2 entry not logged. Discipline breakdown caught and corrected (this entry was added manually).

**Story beats captured (Phase 2 Step 1)**

| # | Beat | Tag |
|---|------|-----|
| 14 | "Bolt produced gold-standard token integration in the Tailwind config — every color, spacing, z-index, font, breakpoint pulled from tokens.json. Because the spec was written down, Bolt couldn't get the foundation wrong even if it tried. The discipline pays off the moment AI tools meet a real codebase." | `ai-augmented-build`, `pm-discipline` |
| 15 | "Bolt's default scaffold leaked a Netlify dependency despite Vercel being locked in CLAUDE.md. The tool has its own opinions. Caught it in audit before deploy — exactly the failure mode the Phase 3 audit step in ADR-001 was designed to catch. Trust but verify." | `tool-choice`, `pm-discipline` |
| 16 | "Bolt claimed in its status report that it had updated working-memory.md as part of the Foundation phase. It hadn't. I logged the Phase 2 entry myself. Real lesson: AI status reports describe intent, not always action. The audit step exists because the AI's self-report is unreliable." | `ai-augmented-build`, `pm-discipline` |

---

### Phase 3 — Claude Code Audit & Structural Fixes (pending)

Planning session: have Claude Code audit Bolt's output against `BRAND.md`, `COMPONENTS.md`, and tokens. Fix component composition, type safety, routing, accessibility. Mobile responsiveness verified or built where Bolt fell short.

---

### Phase 4 — Shopify Integration + Reviews Provider (pending)

Storefront API client, typed responses, cart via Shopify Cart API (not local state), checkout handoff via `checkoutUrl`, webhook handlers for inventory.

**Plus:** Reviews provider integration (whichever is chosen pre-Phase 2 per ADR-002).

---

### Phase 5 — Observability Instrumentation (pending)

PostHog + Vercel Analytics + Supabase mirror. Event taxonomy defined pre-launch. Success metrics document committed before traffic arrives. Age gate behavior + floating promo trigger logic finalized here based on event design.

---

### Phase 6 — Production Agent (pending)

n8n cron → data gathering → Claude API with tool schema → structured report → Slack + email. Agent *proposes* tests, never *runs* them.

---

### Phase 7 — Launch & First Loop (pending)

Soft launch. Two weeks of agent runs before trusting output.

## Open Questions (rolling)

**Pre-Phase-2 (blocking):**

None. Phase 2 unblocked.

**Action items for Phase 2 kickoff:**
- Email ReviewInfra to confirm: (1) does a read API exist for fetching reviews as JSON, (2) does any AI summary feature exist or is on roadmap

**Pre-launch (non-blocking until later):**
- AI Summary final approach (pending ReviewInfra response)
- ReviewInfra Path A vs Path B (pending ReviewInfra response)
- Floating promo trigger logic + frequency cap
- Section 6 empty frame on homepage — cut, design, or defer
- Venue card photography sourcing
- FAQ #3 placeholder copy (homepage)
- Contact page FAQ body copy (mostly placeholder)
- "Danksaber" direct competitor mention — keep, reframe, or remove
- "LITSABER OG +" title — verify `+` is intentional
- 2-Pack "SAVE $20" badge math reconciliation
- Engineering kinetic animation system spec

**Post-launch:**
- `Litsaber_Wholesale_Pricing_2026.pdf` rewrite (4 tiers, MOQ 5)
- `Litsaber_Business_Competence_Cheat_Sheet.pdf` update (41 LEDs, 10 colors)

---

## Glossary

- **Repositioning thesis:** The single-sentence strategic claim driving the rebuild.
- **Production agent:** The weekly automated analyst that proposes A/B tests from observed data.
- **Tool-per-phase:** The principle that no single tool owns the whole build.
- **Human-in-the-loop:** The agent proposes; the human approves and ships. Trust layer, not a bottleneck.
- **ADR:** Architecture Decision Record. A short markdown doc capturing context, decision, and consequences for a significant call.
- **Phase 1.5:** Mid-phase reconciliation between Phase 1 (design tokens + repo) and Phase 2 (Bolt scaffold), introduced because mobile UI and additional pages came in after Phase 1 close.
