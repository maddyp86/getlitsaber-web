# Litsaber Website Rebuild — Working Memory

A live log of the build, decisions made, and story beats captured along the way. Use this as the source for content posts and interview narratives. Updated phase by phase.

---

## Project at a Glance

**What:** Replatform `getlitsaber.com` from WordPress/Avada to a modern Next.js storefront on Shopify, instrumented with a production AI agent that runs weekly conversion analysis and proposes A/B tests.

**Why now:** The current WordPress/Avada site was an agency build that prioritized output over outcomes. Conversion data didn't support the spec-sheet narrative the site led with. The rebuild does two things at once: (1) reposition Litsaber from "vape battery" to "festival accessory that happens to hit 510 carts," and (2) replace a static marketing site with a learning system that compounds.

**Repositioning thesis (locked):**
> Litsaber is a festival accessory that happens to hit 510 carts — not a vape battery with an LED. Its meant for buyers who self-identify by what's visible at the night, not by what's hidden in their pocket. Every product, copy, design, and channel decision should foreground visibility, lifestyle, and the engineered hardware that makes it credible — and should refuse any framing that competes Litsaber on discretion, commodity vape specs, or low price.

## Tool Stack & Rationale

| Phase | Tool | Why this tool |
|------|------|---------------|
| Design | Figma | Source of truth for visual + messaging decisions |
| Scaffold | Bolt | Fastest path from Figma to working Next.js code |
| Build & integrate | Claude Code | Owns whole repo, plans multi-file changes, runs commands — right mode for integration work |
| Commerce | Shopify Storefront API | Hosted checkout removes a class of compliance + payment risk (Stripe is off-limits for vape) |
| Analytics | PostHog + Vercel Analytics | Free tier, feature flags, performance — covers product + perf |
| Data surface | Supabase | Clean SQL surface the production agent can query directly |
| Orchestration | n8n | Existing fluency; better story than custom Python service |
| Agent reasoning | Claude API (tools) | Lets the agent query the database for follow-ups |

**The PM principle here:** match the tool to the job per phase. No single tool for the whole build. The narrative beat for interviews is *tool-fit reasoning*, not *tool fluency*.

---

## Workflow Decisions (locked)

- **GitHub is the single source of truth.** Code, context docs, working memory all live in the repo. Nothing in Notion or a side Google Doc.
- **Git workflow:** Direct push to `main` for Phase 1 (docs only). Switch to feature branches + self-merged PRs + Vercel preview deploys from Phase 2 forward.
- **`CLAUDE.md` at root.** Claude Code reads it automatically every session.
- **ADRs in `/docs/decisions/`.** Significant architecture calls get one markdown file each.
- **Conventional Commits.**
- **Secrets hygiene:** `.env.example` committed, `.env.local` gitignored, real values in Vercel dashboard.
- **Skipped for now:** pre-commit hooks, Dependabot, automated tests.
- **Hosting: Vercel.** Locked. Made by the Next.js team, ships features for Next.js first, tightest fit for the framework. Hobby tier free at launch. Pro tier ($20/mo) likely 6+ months in driven by production agent function time.
- **Domain registrar:** Namecheap (existing). Domain getlitsaber.com stays at Namecheap. DNS A/CNAME records will be pointed at Vercel during Phase 6/7 launch cutover. No registrar migration.
- **Migration cutover:** Build the new site on Vercel under its default preview URL. Existing WordPress/Avada site continues serving getlitsaber.com until the new build is verified. DNS flip is the actual launch moment. 1–2 week parallel period for rollback safety. Logged for Phase 7.

## Build Log

### Phase 1 — Design Tokens & Repo Foundation ✅

**Goal:** Give Bolt and Claude Code structured context to work from, so the codebase reflects Figma decisions and brand strategy from day one.

**Deliverables**
- [x] `tokens.json` — design tokens
- [x] `BRAND.md` — voice, audience, repositioning thesis
- [x] `COMPONENTS.md` — initial component inventory pulled from homepage Figma
- [x] `CLAUDE.md` — persistent operational context for the agent
- [x] `README.md` — human-facing project entry point
- [x] `.gitignore` and `.env.example`
- [x] `docs/decisions/001-tool-stack-and-phasing.md`
- [x] GitHub repo init with first commit

**Decisions logged in Phase 1**
1. **Repositioning thesis locked** — every downstream decision routes through it.
2. **Font stack is five fonts:** Stellar (display), Monoton (accent), Orbitron (sub-headings), Inter (body), Space Mono (labels). Stellar is paid-licensed and self-hosted via `next/font/local`.
3. **Tokens are reverse-engineered, not exported.** Figma file had no defined variables/styles. We defined the token system ourselves.
4. **MSRP is $59.99**, locked.
5. **GitHub-first context architecture** — strategy docs live in the repo, not in a side doc.
6. **Mobile derived from desktop, in Phase 3, not Phase 2.** (Updated in Phase 1.5 — mobile Figma frames now exist; this decision is reversed.)

---

### Phase 1.5 — Scope Expansion & Mobile/Desktop Reconciliation ✅

**Goal:** Pull the rest of the design context (mobile frames, additional pages, cart system, modals) before kicking off Phase 2.

**What happened**
- User built out the full mobile UI in Figma between Phase 1 close and Phase 2 start
- Pulled 14+ frames across Mobile and Desktop Figma pages via the Figma MCP integration
- Hit a Starter-tier rate limit mid-pull; user upgraded to Professional to unblock
- Several frames timed out (Policies page in particular) — handled by treating as known templated pattern rather than blocking on a full pull
- Final inventory: 8 pages, 2 modals, full cart system, full reviews subsystem, ~78 components total

**Deliverables**
- [x] `tokens.json` — updated with cart drawer dimensions, modal widths, z-index layer system, component sizing tokens
- [x] `BRAND.md` — MSRP corrected to $59.99, five-font system noted, social proof stats locked
- [x] `COMPONENTS.md` — fully rewritten covering all 8 pages + modals + cart + reviews subsystem
- [x] `CLAUDE.md` — added age gate compliance rules, reviews provider note, expanded commerce constraints (MOQ 5, 4-tier wholesale)
- [x] `docs/decisions/002-scope-expansion-eight-page-site.md` — ADR documenting the scope change

**Decisions logged in Phase 1.5**
1. **Site map is 8 pages, not 1.** Homepage + PDP + Engineering + Wholesale + About + Activate + Contact + Policies (5 sub-pages).
2. **Wholesale MOQ is 5** (locked). 80 case pack. 4 tiers: Initiate / Knight / Archon / Legend.
3. **"TEN WAYS TO BE SEEN"** is canonical, not "TWELVE." Hero spec pill reads "10 Colors."
4. **Age Gate is compliance-critical** — must sit at top z-index, required for vape category. Behavior policy (cookie duration, etc.) deferred to Phase 2.
5. **Reviews subsystem on PDP is its own complete system** — rating summary, distribution chart, AI summary, photo carousel, search, filter chips, paginated review cards. Provider undecided; build with mock data in Phase 2, integrate in Phase 4.
6. **PDP long-form copy needs rewrite.** Current Figma copy ("Ignite your night... world's first... glow-up accessory") violates BRAND.md voice rules.
7. **Phase 2 timeline extended** from 5–7 days to 10–14 days due to scope expansion. Total project timeline now ~6–7 weeks.
8. **Phase 2 build order locked:** Foundation → Homepage → PDP → Cart → Wholesale + About → Engineering + Activate → Contact + Policies.
9. **Mobile is no longer derived in Phase 3.** User built mobile Figma frames; mobile gets scaffolded in Phase 2 alongside desktop. (Reverses Phase 1 decision.)

**Real inconsistencies surfaced and resolved**
- "TEN WAYS" vs "TWELVE WAYS" → TEN (Figma + spec pill updated)
- Charge time conflict (20 mins vs 75 mins) → 75 mins fixed in Figma
- 3.7v voltage label → fixed in Figma
- Duplicate spec grid rows → fixed in Figma
- Wholesale MOQ inconsistency (25 vs 5) → 5 (Figma + COMPONENTS.md updated)
- Wholesale case pack inconsistency (80 vs 100) → 80 (Figma)
- Wholesale tier count (9 vs 4 vs 6) → 4 tiers (Figma + checklist updated)
- "RETAILER MARGING" typo → fixed
- Spec pill "1.5yr Power settings" mislabel → fixed
- Hero "12 Colors" → "10 Colors" (fixed)

**Drift items flagged but not yet resolved**
- Desktop homepage Wholesale CTA still reads "MOQ 25 · 100+" (needs Figma update)
- Desktop footer missing Social icons + "DESIGNED IN LA | ASSEMBLED IN ASIA" (in mobile, not desktop)
- "$59.00" typo in cart drawer (should be $59.99)
- "REVIEWINFRA" placeholder needs real provider name
- "LITSABER OG +" PDP title — is the `+` intentional?
- 2-Pack "SAVE $20" badge math is $19.99 — round up or keep?
- FAQ Contact page mentions competitor "Danksaber" by name — keep, reframe, or remove?
- ~~Empty Section 6 (1440×1820) on desktop homepage between FAQs and Reviews~~ → now built as the `WhatWereShipping` section (Editions row + ProductDisplay), Phase 1a/1b complete
- FAQ #3 placeholder copy on homepage ("How long does the battery last?")
- Contact FAQ answers are mostly boilerplate placeholder — need real copy pre-launch

**Outreach materials to reconcile post-launch (separate from web build)**
- `Litsaber_Wholesale_Pricing_2026.pdf` shows 9 tiers + MOQ 25; needs rewrite to 4 tiers + MOQ 5
- `Litsaber_Business_Competence_Cheat_Sheet.pdf` shows 31 LEDs + 10–12 colors; needs update to 41 LEDs + 10 colors

**Pre-Phase-2 decisions locked (closeout)**
1. **Reviews provider: ReviewInfra** (https://reviewinfra.dev). Script-tag widget integration model. Phase 4 default approach: Path A (use widget as-is). Stretch: Path B (data API, render our own UI) pending confirmation from ReviewInfra that a read API exists. Action item: email ReviewInfra to confirm.
2. **AI Summary: open.** ReviewInfra docs don't advertise an AI summary feature. Three options: (a) confirm built-in support with ReviewInfra, (b) build a custom Claude API endpoint that synthesizes reviews server-side and caches, (c) skip the `<AISummaryCard />` for v1. Decision deferred to post-ReviewInfra-conversation.
3. **Bundle SKU: quantity discount on single SKU.** 2-Pack is not a separate Shopify product. Cart adds 2× the single SKU + applies the discount.
4. **PDP long-form copy: approved for rewrite.** Current Figma copy ("Ignite your night... world's first... glow-up accessory") to be replaced with copy matching BRAND.md voice during Phase 2 scaffold. Claude Code will draft and flag for review before commit.
5. **Age gate: locked.** First-visit cookie (`litsaber_age_verified`), 30-day duration, hard wall, EXIT → google.com. Env vars committed in `.env.example`.

**Pre-Phase-2 decisions still open (non-blocking)**

None. Phase 2 unblocked.

**Story beats captured (Phase 1.5)**

| # | Beat | Tag |
|---|------|-----|
| 6 | "Scope expanded ~5x between Phase 1 spec and Phase 2 kickoff. 1 page became 8. I didn't push back on the scope. I re-scoped the timeline and the build order — and wrote an ADR explaining why before touching the next prompt. Re-planning is the senior signal; pretending the plan still fits isn't." | `pm-discipline` |
| 7 | "Hit a Figma MCP rate limit mid-pull. Didn't argue with it — picked the recovery path that preserved the discipline (extract spec before scaffold) without blocking. User upgraded mid-conversation; I picked the next-highest-leverage frame to pull rather than restarting." | `tool-choice`, `pm-discipline` |
| 8 | "Pulled the Figma file and surfaced 11 real cross-document inconsistencies — MOQ, case pack, tier count, voltage labels, color count, copy duplicates. None of them are bugs in code. They're inconsistencies in the SPEC. Catching them before Bolt sees them prevents an entire class of rework." | `discovery`, `pm-discipline` |
| 9 | "The Activate page is the secret weapon. Post-purchase onboarding most DTC brands skip — designed to reduce support tickets and reinforce the engineering thesis. Sticky chip nav, 8 functional sections, inline demo videos, QR-scan-from-box entry detection. Shipping in Phase 2, not deferred to v2." | `discovery` |
| 10 | "The PDP reviews section turned out to be a full subsystem — not a card list. Rating summary, distribution chart, AI-summary card, photo carousel, search, filter chips, paginated cards. Identifying it as a subsystem rather than a single component changes the Phase 4 provider decision from cosmetic to structural." | `discovery`, `integration-depth` |
| 11 | "Figma's PDP description copy was AI-toned ('Ignite your night... world's first... glow-up accessory'). It violated every rule in BRAND.md. Caught it because the voice rules were written down and load on every Claude Code session — the discipline does the work I'd otherwise have to do manually." | `pm-discipline`, `ai-augmented-build` |
| 12 | "Reviews provider was ReviewInfra — a small script-tag product, not a Yotpo/Stamped-scale platform. The integration model forces a real Phase 4 decision: ship their widget as-is and lose brand control on the PDP, or build a custom UI against their data API (if it exists). I logged it as Path A vs Path B in CLAUDE.md and made the email-to-ReviewInfra an explicit action item rather than guessing." | `tool-choice`, `integration-depth` |
| 13 | "Hosting choice came up mid-build. Default temptation is to pick whatever's familiar. I picked Vercel for a specific reason: it's made by the Next.js team, ships framework features first, and its serverless functions are the natural home for the Phase 6 production agent. Netlify would have worked — Vercel wins on tool-fit, not marketing. The domain stays at Namecheap. Registrar migration is a different decision and there's no reason to do it." | `tool-choice`, `pm-discipline` |

### Phase 2 — Foundation Complete (2026-05-20) ✅

**Goal:** Foundation phase — layout shell, global components, page stubs, token system.

**Deliverables**
- [x] Next.js 14, App Router, TypeScript strict mode, Tailwind CSS
- [x] `tailwind.config.ts` — all tokens from `tokens.json` mapped to named utilities (colors, fonts, spacing, radii, shadows, z-index, etc.)
- [x] `lib/fonts.ts` — Monoton, Orbitron, Inter, Space Mono via `next/font/google`; Stellar placeholder via CSS variable with system fallback, commented localFont block ready for when font file arrives
- [x] `app/globals.css` — Tailwind directives, Stellar placeholder var, scroll-lock class
- [x] `app/layout.tsx` — root layout with font variables, metadata, `<AgeGateModal />`, `<Navbar />`, `{children}`, `<Footer />` in order
- [x] `components/layout/Navbar.tsx` — sticky, transparent over hero, solid black on scroll; logo left, nav links center, user+cart icons right; hamburger mobile trigger
- [x] `components/layout/MobileNavDrawer.tsx` — full-screen drawer, 5 nav items with submenu indicators, expandable Quick Links, footer CTA + login link, scroll lock, focus management, Escape key close
- [x] `components/layout/Footer.tsx` — logo+tagline, social icons (Instagram, YouTube, TikTok), "DESIGNED IN LA" tagline on both mobile and desktop (drift resolved), 3 nav columns, compliance disclaimer, policy links, payment strip
- [x] `components/layout/AgeGateModal.tsx` — hard wall, cookie read on mount, 30-day max-age on confirm, EXIT link to google.com, reads all config from env vars
- [x] 14 page stubs (/, /shop/litsaber-og, /the-tech, /wholesale, /about, /activate, /contact, /cart, /policies/refunds, /policies/warranty, /policies/shipping, /policies/terms, /policies/privacy) — each with stub content and page-level metadata
- [x] Build passes clean — `next build` produces 14 static routes, no type errors

**Decisions made in this phase**

1. **Bolt bypassed for foundation.** Bolt was in the Phase 2 plan for scaffold, but Claude Code built the foundation layer directly. Reason: the token system, compliance constraints (age gate), and component spec were precise enough that Bolt's ~70% fidelity would have required a full audit pass anyway. Direct build is faster for components with locked specs.
2. **Stellar font uses CSS variable placeholder.** `next/font/local` requires the font file to exist at build time. Since Stellar.woff2 hasn't been added yet (paid license), the lib/fonts.ts has the `localFont` block commented out with clear instructions. The CSS variable `--font-stellar` falls back to "Arial Black" / Impact / system-ui. When the file arrives, drop it at `public/fonts/Stellar.woff2`, uncomment the localFont block, and remove the CSS variable override in globals.css.
3. **Footer drift resolved.** COMPONENTS.md flagged that the desktop footer was missing social icons and "DESIGNED IN LA" tagline (they existed on mobile only). Both are now on both breakpoints from the start — no deferred reconciliation needed.
4. **js-cookie removed.** Age gate uses `document.cookie` directly rather than introducing a dependency. Simpler, no bundle cost, sufficient for a single compliance cookie.

**Story beats (Phase 2 foundation)**

| # | Beat | Tag |
|---|------|-----|
| 13 | "Built the foundation layer directly instead of waiting for Bolt. The token system was precise, the age gate behavior was locked, and the component spec was detailed enough that a 70%-fidelity scaffold would have needed a full rewrite. Skipping a step isn't cutting corners when the step was designed for a different level of spec ambiguity." | `pm-discipline`, `tool-choice` |
| 14 | "The Stellar font placeholder pattern — commenting out the `localFont` block with exact instructions for when the file arrives — is a small thing that prevents a class of 'why doesn't the font look right' confusion later. The placeholder communicates intent; Arial Black communicates absence." | `ai-augmented-build` |
| 15 | "Caught the desktop footer drift before Phase 3 even started. Social icons and 'DESIGNED IN LA' are on both breakpoints in the first commit. One less thing to reconcile." | `pm-discipline` |

---

### Phase 2 — Homepage complete + Commerce Phases 2 + 3a/3b/3c-1 complete (2026-05-26) ✅

**Goal:** Build all homepage sections, local cart store, cart drawer, and waitlist form + API route.

**Sequencing (locked in ADR-002):**
1. Foundation — Layout shell, Navbar, Footer, mobile drawer, age gate modal ✅
2. Homepage — All sections in scroll order ✅
3. PDP — Product info, styles/bundles, mock data only. Reviews subsystem with seed data. (pending)
4. Cart — Drawer + page + line items + promo code (local state, no Shopify yet) ✅ (drawer + store built; `/cart` page pending)
5. Wholesale + About — Lower-risk pages (pending)
6. Engineering + Activate — Higher complexity (kinetic animation, sticky chip nav) (pending)
7. Contact + Policies — Templated, fastest to ship (pending)

#### Phase 2 — Step 1: Foundation ✅ (deployed to Vercel) — see entry above

**Bolt output audited.** Build passes, preview works, all 13 routes render. Quality of token integration in `tailwind.config.ts` is gold-standard — every value imports from `tokens.json`, no inline hex anywhere. Accessibility on the modal/drawer is genuinely good (scroll lock, focus management, Escape close, full ARIA labeling). Footer drift from Phase 1.5 resolved — socials + "DESIGNED IN LA" present on both mobile and desktop.

**Three problems caught in audit and fixed:**
1. **Netlify leak resolved.** Bolt installed `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` and created `netlify.toml` despite the Vercel decision being locked in CLAUDE.md. Removed via cleanup prompt.
2. **Dotfile damage fixed.** `.gitignore` had been overwritten by a 2-line Bolt stub, leaving the real 59-line version under a no-dot filename Git was ignoring. `env.example` had also lost its leading dot. Both restored via GitHub web editor.
3. **Working memory restored.** Bolt claimed it had updated `working-memory.md` but hadn't. Logged manually.

**Vercel deploy complete.**
- Repo connected to Vercel via Hobby plan
- Auto-deploy from `main` branch configured
- Three age gate env vars set (`NEXT_PUBLIC_AGE_GATE_COOKIE_NAME`, `..._MAX_AGE_DAYS`, `..._EXIT_URL`)
- Live preview URL responsive to all 5 verification tests: Age Gate appears, dismisses on confirm, persists across refresh, all 5 nav routes work, mobile drawer opens with full nav
- From here forward, every push to `main` auto-deploys; every PR gets a unique preview URL

**Story beats captured (Phase 2 Step 1)**

| # | Beat | Tag |
|---|------|-----|
| 14 | "Bolt produced gold-standard token integration in the Tailwind config — every color, spacing, z-index, font, breakpoint pulled from tokens.json. Because the spec was written down, Bolt couldn't get the foundation wrong even if it tried. The discipline pays off the moment AI tools meet a real codebase." | `ai-augmented-build`, `pm-discipline` |
| 15 | "Bolt's default scaffold leaked a Netlify dependency despite Vercel being locked in CLAUDE.md. The tool has its own opinions. Caught it in audit before deploy — exactly the failure mode the Phase 3 audit step in ADR-001 was designed to catch. Trust but verify." | `tool-choice`, `pm-discipline` |
| 16 | "Bolt claimed in its status report that it had updated working-memory.md as part of the Foundation phase. It hadn't. I logged the Phase 2 entry myself. Real lesson: AI status reports describe intent, not always action. The audit step exists because the AI's self-report is unreliable." | `ai-augmented-build`, `pm-discipline` |
| 17 | "Foundation phase shipped to production-grade infrastructure: GitHub repo, auto-deploying Vercel pipeline, env vars wired, Age Gate compliant and working on the live URL. The bar is no longer 'does it work in Bolt's preview' — it's 'does it work on the actual production CDN.' Three weeks from Figma file to working pipeline." | `pm-discipline` |

---

#### Phase 2 — Step 1.6: Palette reconciliation + Motion system

**What happened:** User surfaced a motion design system doc and two component files (`BuySection.tsx`, `SectionStarfield.tsx`) from an earlier Vite prototype. Audited them. The motion doc was high-quality and worth keeping; the two `.tsx` files carried stale data (3-pack bundles, $60/$110/$150 pricing, "12 Colors", 30-day-vs-6-month warranty conflict, a different synthwave palette).

**Palette decision (locked, v0.3.0 hybrid):**
- Background: `#0A0518` deep purple-black (was pure black `#000000`)
- 3 decorative accents: cyan `#00E5FF`, magenta `#FF00E5`, purple `#9D5FFF` (purple is new)
- CTA / conversion color: pink `#EC5793` (new — the "money color," also the gradient endpoint). User specified this exact hex, replacing the prototype's `#FF1F7A`.
- Gradient: purple → pink (`#9D5FFF` → `#EC5793`)
- Text primary shifted `#FFFFFF` → `#F0F0F5` to match the motion doc

**Deliverables:**
- [x] `tokens.json` bumped to v0.3.0 — color/gradient/shadow sections rewritten. Added `accent.purple`, `cta` color family, `surface.tint-purple`/`tint-cta`, `gradient.cta` + `gradient.cta-radial`, `shadow.glow-purple`/`glow-cta`/`glow-cta-hover`.
- [x] `MOTION.md` created as a permanent repo artifact (sibling to BRAND.md). Full motion system reconciled to the hybrid palette. Starfield technique captured without the stale prototype values.
- [x] `CLAUDE.md` updated — points at MOTION.md, documents the v0.3.0 palette and the cascade note.

**Cascade impact:** Foundation components (Navbar, Footer, AgeGate) reference named tokens, so they inherit new hex values automatically when Tailwind rebuilds — no code change needed for the background/text shift. BUT any CTA built using cyan as the action color should switch to the new pink `cta` token. Verify during the next Bolt pass or the Phase 3 audit.

**The two prototype `.tsx` files: reference only, NOT merged.** Useful patterns (carousel with fade, sticky product image, bundle selector, accordions, section starfield) but wrong framework (Vite not Next.js), wrong palette, wrong prices, wrong bundle count. Bolt re-implements fresh against current spec. Starfield *technique* captured in MOTION.md Part 5.

**Story beats captured (Phase 2 Step 1.6)**

| # | Beat | Tag |
|---|------|-----|
| 18 | "Inherited a motion design doc and two component files from an earlier prototype. The doc was gold; the components carried stale prices, bundle structure, and a different palette. Rather than paste them in and re-introduce resolved inconsistencies, I extracted the doc into a permanent MOTION.md artifact and flagged the components as reference-only. Knowing what to keep vs. what to quarantine is the actual skill." | `pm-discipline`, `discovery` |
| 19 | "Palette went hybrid mid-build: purple-black canvas, three accents, a dedicated pink CTA color. Because everything routes through tokens.json, the change was one file edit — every component referencing named tokens inherited it automatically. This is why we built the token system in Phase 1 instead of inlining colors. The discipline compounds." | `pm-discipline`, `ai-augmented-build` |

**Homepage structure decision (locked):** The homepage has its **own full buy section** (`<HomepageBuySection />`) — product carousel, style selector (Silver/Gold), bundle selector (Single/2-Pack), Add to Cart, accordions, with `<SectionStarfield />` behind it. Not just a link to the PDP. Spec'd in COMPONENTS.md with all prototype data corrected: $59.99 single, $99.99 2-Pack (save $20), no 3-pack, 10 colors, warranty figure flagged for reconciliation. Anchor is `id="buy"` (not `id="shop"`, which collides with the `/shop/litsaber-og` route).

---

#### Phase 2 — Step 2: Hero section (built, corrected)

**Built hero-first** (broke the homepage into per-section chunks rather than the original two-pass split). Bolt produced `<Hero />` plus reusable `<Reveal>` and `<SpecPill>` primitives. The hero is the most-judged component and sets the motion/color patterns for every later section, so it earned its own pass.

**Bolt flagged three Figma discrepancies — all resolved:**
1. Hero image not found → turned out the entire `public/` folder had been wiped (see incident below). Real path is `public/images/home/`, not `public/images/hero/`.
2. Figma shows a product render in the hero; the Phase 1.5 spec omitted it → **Figma was right.** COMPONENTS.md hero spec corrected to include the device render. Locked: hero shows the device.
3. Figma shows the "Glowstick meets 510 battery" tagline at large display size; spec said small eyebrow → **Figma was right.** It's the repositioning thesis line; it earns weight. COMPONENTS.md corrected. Locked: large display statement with cyan glow.

**Hero assets (confirmed in repo):**
- `public/images/home/hero-lifestyle.png` — background scene
- `public/images/home/litsaber-hero-image.png` — device render, layered on top

**Corrective prompt issued** to wire real images, add the product render, resize the tagline — as a patch to existing `<Hero />`, not a rebuild.

#### Phase 2 — INCIDENT: public/ folder wiped by Bolt sync

**What happened:** The entire `public/images/` folder (uploaded across 3 commits ~17–19h prior) disappeared from the repo. Root cause: two-sources-of-truth collision. Images were added directly via GitHub/GitHub Desktop; Bolt's workspace never had them; a Bolt sync produced a `Merge branch 'main'` commit that dropped `public/` because Bolt's view didn't include it.

**Recovery:** Images were still in git history (commit `319096d`). Restored via `git checkout 319096d -- public/` → commit → push. No data lost. (Alternative paths considered: GitHub Desktop revert, ZIP-download-and-re-upload.)

**Prevention (now locked in CLAUDE.md):** Single write path to the repo. During Phase 2, all files enter through Bolt. No direct GitHub edits while Bolt is the active editor. This is the second Bolt collision (first was the Netlify dependency leak in Step 1) — both are arguments for the Claude Code handoff after the homepage scaffold.

**Story beats captured (Phase 2 Step 2 + incident)**

| # | Beat | Tag |
|---|------|-----|
| 20 | "Broke the homepage into per-section chunks instead of building it in big passes. Started with the hero alone — most-judged component, sets every downstream pattern. Smaller chunks meant tighter review and less rework. Scoping the unit of work is a PM call, not a coding one." | `pm-discipline` |
| 21 | "Bolt flagged three places where Figma and my spec disagreed. On two of them — product render in the hero, tagline size — Figma was right and my Phase 1.5 spec was stale. The discipline that mattered wasn't 'spec always wins'; it was building the prompt so Bolt surfaces the conflict instead of silently picking. Then a human decides." | `pm-discipline`, `ai-augmented-build` |
| 22 | "Lost the entire image folder to a Bolt sync collision — Bolt merged its view of main over mine and dropped files it never knew about. Recovered in two minutes from git history (`git checkout <commit> -- public/`). The real lesson wasn't the recovery, it was the root cause: two write paths to one repo will always eventually collide. Locked a single-write-path rule and accelerated the plan to drop Bolt for Claude Code. Version control turned a 'lost a day of work' into a 'lost two minutes.'" | `integration-depth`, `pm-discipline` |

---

### Phase 3 — Claude Code Audit & Structural Fixes (pending)

Planning session: have Claude Code audit Bolt's output against `BRAND.md`, `COMPONENTS.md`, and tokens. Fix component composition, type safety, routing, accessibility. Mobile responsiveness verified or built where Bolt fell short.

**Handoff to Claude Code complete (mid-Phase-2):** Environment set up locally — Node 20 via nvm, pnpm, Claude Code installed, `pnpm dev` running. Bolt retired after repeated sync collisions (Netlify leak, image-folder wipe, a merge-conflict that landed unresolved markers in Hero.tsx). Single write path now: local repo + Claude Code + git. The remaining homepage sections and all subsequent phases run through Claude Code.

**Responsive image pattern (locked):** Most images have separate mobile/desktop assets (different filename, dimensions, sometimes format — e.g. `hero-lifestyle.png` desktop / `hero-lifestyle-mobile.jpg` mobile). Standardized on a `<ResponsiveImage />` primitive using `<picture>` so browsers fetch only the needed asset (critical for `priority` hero images). Documented in COMPONENTS.md (primitive spec) and CLAUDE.md (standing convention). Applies across hero, venue cards, section backgrounds — build once, reuse everywhere.

**Mobile/desktop component strategy (locked — ADR-003):** The Figma mobile and desktop homepage frames diverge structurally, not just by reflow. Decision: per-section criterion, not a blanket rule. Default to one responsive component; SPLIT into `*.desktop.tsx`/`*.mobile.tsx` only when DOM structure or content grouping genuinely changes (not merely "looks different"). The hero is the first confirmed split — its headline regroups which words are cyan between breakpoints (`HIGHLIGHT THE` + `NIGHT` desktop vs `HIGHLIGHT` + `THE NIGHT` mobile), which one DOM can't express cleanly. All splits share content + primitives (duplicate arrangement, never content) and use CSS toggle (`hidden lg:block`), never JS rendering (SSR/flash/hydration). Full rationale + per-section checklist in ADR-003.

**Hero refactor pivot:** The earlier-approved flow-based refactor of the *single responsive* hero was superseded by the split decision. Instead of one flow-based responsive hero, the hero becomes `HeroDesktop` + `HeroMobile` + a CSS-toggle wrapper + shared `hero.content.ts`. Flow-based principles (no magic pixel offsets, token spacing) still apply — within each of the two simpler single-breakpoint components. The brittle pixel-offset problem is solved by the split (each component targets one layout) rather than by making one component flow across all breakpoints.

| 23 | "The hero kept fighting me on every spacing tweak because it used absolute pixel offsets coupled across two background layers. Diagnosed it as brittle architecture, not a styling bug. The fix wasn't another tweak — it was recognizing the layout method itself was wrong for the job." | `pm-discipline`, `integration-depth` |
| 24 | "Pulled the full mobile and desktop Figma frames and saw the divergence was structural, not cosmetic — the hero headline literally regroups which words are cyan between breakpoints. Resisted two easy wrong answers: 'force one responsive component' (would need conditional word-grouping hacks) and 'split everything' (doubles maintenance across the whole site). Landed on a per-section structural-divergence test, documented as ADR-003. The judgment was in the criterion, not the binary." | `pm-discipline` |

**Be Seen Across The Crowd — scroll-pinned scrollytelling (building):** The most complex section on the site. Three stages (THE LIFESTYLE / THE INTERACTION / THE ENDURANCE), each a full-bleed image + text block + 3-bar progress indicator. SPLIT per ADR-003 — this is the second confirmed split, and it refined the criterion: desktop and mobile share the SAME interaction (scroll-pin advance through stages, tappable bars) but split on divergent layout, type scale, gradient direction, and image assets. A split doesn't require different interactions, just different enough structure.

**Exact specs both breakpoints (authoritative, from Figma + user):** Desktop (node `3416:3337`) 1440×900, text column 580px left, headline Stellar Bold 75px / body Inter 22px / eyebrow Space Mono 16px, gradient left→dark, image right. Mobile (nodes `3760:8705`/`3760:5351`) 375×650, text 327px / 20px padding, headline 45px / body 18px / eyebrow 14px, gradient bottom→top, image full-bleed. Bars identical: 40×5px, 24px gap, cyan active / `#828282` inactive. Six images: `litsaber-{festival,interaction,endurance}.jpg` (desktop) + `-mobile.jpg` (mobile).

**Mechanism (locked before build):** tall section (300vh, 100vh/stage) + `position: sticky` inner pinned for the scroll duration + Framer Motion `useScroll`/`useTransform` to derive active stage from scroll progress. Explicitly NOT wheel-hijacking — the browser scrolls naturally, the component reacts to position. Progress bars are both indicator and control: clicking scrolls the window to the stage position (not just setting state, which would desync). `prefers-reduced-motion` falls back to stacked stages, no pin. Files: `components/home/BeSeen/{crowd.content.ts, BeSeenDesktop.tsx, BeSeenMobile.tsx, BeSeen.tsx}` + shared scroll hook.

**Figma-structure correction logged to CLAUDE.md:** The file is ONE page ("Desktop Website"), but it DOES contain mobile variant frames for some sections (hero, Be Seen) — not all. Rule: check whether a mobile node exists; if yes match it exactly, if no derive mobile from desktop via tokens. Earlier shorthand ("Figma is desktop-only") was imprecise — corrected.

**StatBar marquee (built between hero and Be Seen):** Continuous horizontal ticker, 5 stats, one responsive component (not split — identical structure both breakpoints, only font size differs; a clean example of "not everything splits"). CSS keyframe animation, not Framer Motion — continuous infinite loops belong in CSS (performance, no dropped frames); Framer is for entrance/scroll reactions. Duplicated-track technique for seamless loop. Standard left-scroll (resolved an ambiguity: "left to right" had two readings; the tool asking saved a build cycle). Reduced-motion = static.

**Story beats captured (architecture, continued)**

| 25 | "Three times I gave the AI mobile specs from memory or a screenshot, and twice I was wrong about the actual design — I assumed mobile stacked when it actually used the same scroll-pin as desktop. The fix each time was the same: stop describing, pull the actual Figma node and read it. Reading the file directly beat guessing every single time. For pixel-precise work, the source of truth is the source, not my recollection of it." | `pm-discipline`, `ai-augmented-build` |
| 26 | "Chose the scroll-pin mechanism deliberately: sticky-positioned inner container plus scroll-progress tracking, explicitly NOT wheel-hijacking. Scroll-jacking is the fragile, accessibility-hostile version that fights the user's input device; the sticky approach lets the browser scroll naturally and just reacts to position. Knowing which pattern to reach for — and which superficially-similar one to avoid — is the difference between an effect that feels premium and one that feels broken. Same judgment on the marquee: CSS for continuous loops, Framer for entrance motion." | `integration-depth` |

### Editions + Commerce section — build-phasing plan (2026-05-23, planning)

The homepage's most complex section ("WHAT WE'RE SHIPPING" / Editions + the inline PDP-style product display, Figma node `3312:2`). This is the frame previously logged as the empty "Section 6" open question — now resolved as this feature. Planned the build before writing any code because it bundles UI, cart state, form capture, and a payment integration that, done in one pass, would produce something that looks right and breaks on real commerce data.

**Governing architecture decision:** Decouple UI from commerce. Build all UI against a local cart store (`lib/cart/store.ts`, Zustand + localStorage) exposing a Shopify-shaped interface; swap the store's action bodies to Shopify Storefront API mutations only in the final phase. Components talk to the store, never to Shopify. This isolates integration risk and keeps every builder prompt small. Full spec written into CLAUDE.md ("Commerce build phasing" section).

**Four commercial decisions confirmed by Matt (2026-05-23):**
- **Two Pack = two single SKUs shipped together (FINAL 2026-05-23).** No physical two-pack box, no separate Shopify variant. Driven by ops/inventory: one inventory pool (no allocation guessing), no 3PL kitting map (pick order is "Silver × 2"), QuickBooks stays single-SKU. Front-end models it as one logical cart line ($99.99); Shopify mechanism deferred to Phase 4 (leaning native Bundles, fallback automatic discount on 2× single). Interim "dedicated variant" call was reversed once it was confirmed no physical two-pack exists.
- **Authorize.net** already approved for this store; Shopify hosted checkout routes to it. Wired in Phase 4, not before.
- **HubSpot** handles both new signup flows (Gold waitlist, Future Drops notify) — submit to HubSpot forms, a workflow sends confirmation, contact lands in CRM. No custom backend. Two new forms needed; Matt to create before Phase 3 form wiring.
- **Variant→behavior:** Silver → add to cart + drawer. Gold → waitlist modal (no cart).

**Build sequence (4 phases, each chunk = one prompt = one commit):** P1 static layout (Editions row + product display, inert). P2 local cart store + selection logic + conditional CTA. P3 drawer + `/cart` page + the two HubSpot modals + wire Editions actions. P4 Shopify (client, swap store actions to cart mutations, `checkoutUrl` redirect) — last and isolated. Desktop + mobile both mocked; one responsive component per chunk per ADR-003, split only if responsive logic gets unmanageable mid-build.

**Story beats captured (commerce planning)**

| # | Beat | Tag |
|---|------|-----|
| 27 | "Before building the most complex section on the site, I drew a seam: all UI talks to a local cart store with a Shopify-shaped interface, and Shopify itself gets wired in dead last by swapping only the store's internals. The components never change. The point wasn't the tech — it was refusing to let integration risk contaminate four phases of layout work. Sequencing the unknowns to the end is a PM call." | `pm-discipline`, `integration-depth` |
| 28 | "Reversed my own bundle decision twice and landed where the operations pointed, not where the code was easiest. I first picked a dedicated $99.99 variant because it kept the cart code dumb. Then I asked the real question — what does this do to inventory? — and realized a separate variant splits one physical product into two stock pools, forcing allocation guesses and a 3PL kitting map for a box that doesn't exist. We just ship two units together. So: one SKU, one inventory pool, modeled as a single logical cart line in the UI, with the Shopify mechanism deferred to Phase 4. The lesson: 'simplest code' and 'simplest operations' are different axes, and for a physical-goods business the ops axis wins." | `pm-discipline`, `integration-depth` |

### WhatWereShipping — Phase 1a + 1b built (2026-05-23) ✅

Static layout for both children of the section is built, reviewed, and committed (repo `getlitsaber-web`, `components/home/`).

**Built:**
- `components/home/Editions/` — the 3 CTA boxes (OG Silver / Gold Edition / Future Drops). One responsive component (3-up grid → stacked), per-card accent (cyan/magenta/purple) via a static `ACCENT_CLASSES` lookup (avoids Tailwind JIT string-interpolation trap). Action links inert (Phase 3 wires them). [Phase 1a]
- `components/home/ProductDisplay/` — gallery (vertical thumb strip left of main on desktop, stacked on mobile; 5 thumbs, packaging hero is thumb 1), title/subtitle/price, 6 rectangular spec pills, StyleSelector (Silver active / Gold "Coming Soon"), BundleAndCTA (Single active / Two Pack, both CTAs inert). Silver hardcoded active; no selection or cart logic yet. [Phase 1b]
- `components/home/WhatWereShipping/` — `position: relative` wrapper. Gradient bg over `#0A0518`, `box-shadow 0 4px 4px rgba(0,0,0,.25)`, owns all section padding + vertical rhythm. Inner column `mx-auto w-full max-w-[1250px]`. TODO mount point for the section-scoped `<Starfield>` (Phase Motion). Renders `<Editions />` then `<ProductDisplay />`. **Renamed from `Section6` 2026-05-23** — "Section 6" is a Figma artifact name, retired in code.

**Decisions locked during the build:**
- Title is `LITSABER OG - Silver` (Stellar). Subtitle `The Interactive 510 Battery` (Inter 25px, muted). Price Space Mono 55px (`text-h2`) + pink glow. (Bolt kept guessing Monoton/eyebrow fonts because it can't reach Figma — corrected against node `3335:54` each time.)
- Sizes snap to the existing type scale: 50px Figma values → `text-h2` (55px). No one-off 50px token added.
- New tokens added rather than inline hex: `#120F2C` (card-deep bg), `#424242` (inactive border), `r=10`, `r=5`.
- Two Pack copy: "For the lightshow. For the partner. For the never-without" (partner, not duel).
- Editions box actions CONFIRMED: Box1 → Shop page (navigate, no modal); Box2 → Gold waitlist modal; Box3 → general email-list modal. Resolves the earlier modal-vs-scroll open question — all modals/navigation are Phase 3.

**Workflow learning:** Bolt cannot pull Figma (login wall) — it reconstructs visuals from prompt text and guesses fonts/copy/radii. Mitigation now standing: Claude pulls the Figma node and hands Bolt exact specs (fonts, px, copy, hex) rather than trusting Bolt to "have enough from the codebase audit." Every Bolt plan gets checked against the real node before code.

| 29 | "My builder couldn't see the design file — it was reconstructing the screen from my written description and quietly guessing fonts, copy, and corner radii. Three rounds in I stopped trusting 'I have enough from the codebase' and changed the workflow: I pull the exact spec from the design node and hand it over as literal values — this font, this pixel size, this hex, this verbatim string. The lesson isn't about one tool; it's that when a collaborator is working blind, the fix is to remove the guessing, not to re-check the guesses. Cheaper to feed exact specs than to debug plausible-looking wrong ones." | `pm-discipline`, `ai-collaboration` |

### Phase 2 — Remaining homepage sections built (2026-05-24–26) ✅

All homepage sections are now built and composed in `app/page.tsx` in scroll order:

1. `<Hero />` — split desktop/mobile per ADR-003 ✅ (logged above)
2. `<StatBar />` — continuous CSS marquee, 5 stats ✅ (logged above)
3. `<BeSeen />` — scroll-pinned scrollytelling, 3 stages ✅ (logged above)
4. `<ThreeModes />` — split desktop/mobile per ADR-003
5. `<UnderTheHood />` — split desktop/mobile per ADR-003
6. `<LightMeetsVapor />` — single responsive component, Framer Motion parallax scroll + intersection-observer text reveal
7. `<WhereItLives />` — venue marquee (CSS animation, duplicated-track technique for seamless loop) + animated headline block with intersection observer
8. `<CommonQuestions />` — split desktop/mobile per ADR-003
9. `<WhatWereShipping />` wrapping `<EditionsSection />` + `<ProductDisplay />` ✅ (logged above)

**ThreeModes:** Three product modes (Fade, Pulse, Strobe or equivalent) with shared `useModesState.ts` hook. Split per ADR-003 — structural layout divergence between breakpoints, not just reflow. Files: `ThreeModesDesktop.tsx`, `ThreeModesMobile.tsx`, `ThreeModes.tsx` (CSS-toggle wrapper), `modes.content.ts`, `useModesState.ts`.

**UnderTheHood:** Engineering specs / exploded-view section. Split per ADR-003. Files: `UnderTheHoodDesktop.tsx`, `UnderTheHoodMobile.tsx`, `UnderTheHood.tsx`, `underthehood.content.ts`.

**LightMeetsVapor:** Full-height parallax section ("WHERE LIGHT AND VAPOR MEET"). Single responsive component. Framer Motion `useScroll`/`useTransform` for parallax bg; intersection observer triggers text reveal. Separate aspect ratios per breakpoint (375/600 mobile, 8/5 desktop). Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.

**WhereItLives:** Venue/lifestyle placement section. CSS marquee strip of venue cards (same duplicated-track technique as StatBar — consistent pattern across the codebase now). Animated headline + body block. Files: `WhereItLives.tsx`, `whereitlives.content.ts`.

**CommonQuestions:** FAQ accordion section. Split per ADR-003. Files: `CommonQuestionsDesktop.tsx`, `CommonQuestionsMobile.tsx`, `CommonQuestions.tsx`, `commonquestions.content.ts`.

### Phase 2a/2b/2c + Phase 3a/3b/3c-1 — Commerce UI on a local store (2026-05-25) ✅

The full commerce UI is built and verified against the local cart store. Shopify is still untouched (Phase 4). Each chunk was one Bolt prompt, plan-reviewed against the real Figma node before code, committed separately.

**Phase 2a — local cart store (`lib/cart/store.ts`).** Zustand + `persist` (key `litsaber-cart`). Shopify-shaped `CartLine` ({ id, variantId, qty, title, variantTitle, price, image }). Actions: `addItem` (on matching variantId increments by incoming qty, else pushes a line with `crypto.randomUUID()` id), `removeItem`, `updateQty` (qty<=0 → remove), `clear`. Derived hooks: `useItemCount`, `useSubtotal`, `useCartItems`, `useCartId`. **`cartId` stays `null` through Phases 1–3** — it is Shopify's server cart handle (set by `cartCreate` in Phase 4); a local UUID there would be a value Shopify rejects, forcing Phase 4 to special-case it. The line-level `id` gets the local UUID; that's correct. Verified in isolation with a temporary DEV harness (add/increment/remove/clear, subtotal math) before any UI consumed it; harness removed before commit.

**Phase 2b — selection wiring.** Thumbnail click-to-swap, style select (Silver/Gold), bundle select (Single/Two Pack), and reactive headline price — all local component `useState`, NOT cart state. Active/inactive states from node `3703:7914`: active border `#00E5FF`, inactive `#424242`, card bg `#120F2C`.

**Phase 2c — conditional CTA.** Silver + ADD TO CART → `addItem` then opens the drawer. Gold → swaps the bundle+CTA region for the inline `WaitlistCard` at the 2b seam. BUY NOW stays inert (Phase 4 Shopify checkout).

**Bug — `useCartActions` infinite render loop.** First implementation returned a fresh object literal `{ addItem, removeItem, ... }` from a single Zustand selector. Zustand compares selected values by reference; a new object every render reads as "changed," triggering re-render → new object → re-render. React killed it with "Maximum update depth exceeded." Fix: select each action individually (`useCartStore((s) => s.addItem)`), since action functions are created once in `create()` and keep stable references. Root principle: when a system decides "did this change?" by identity, you must hand it stable identities — a fresh wrapper reads as perpetual change. The hook abstraction was kept; only its internals changed.

**Phase 3a — UI store + CartDrawer.** New `lib/ui/store.ts` (Zustand, no persist) holding `isCartOpen` + `openCart`/`closeCart` — deliberately separate from cart *data*. CartDrawer mounted once in the root layout (openable site-wide), flex-column (fixed header / `flex-1` scrolling list / pinned footer), slide-in with `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback, Esc + backdrop close, focus management. Reads everything from the store — no hardcoded Figma mock values. NO empty state in the drawer (it only opens via `openCart`, which only fires after `addItem`, so zero-items is unreachable). A "VIEW CART" link was added to the drawer footer (navigates to `/cart` + closes drawer) so the cart page isn't orphaned — the navbar icon opens the drawer rather than navigating.

**Navbar cart badge wiring.** The cart icon was built in the foundation phase with a hardcoded `0` and no handler — an unfinished element, not a regression. Wired to `useItemCount()` (badge hidden at 0, pluralized aria-label) and `openCart()`.

**Phase 3b — `/cart` page.** RSC shell + `CartPageBody` client component. Reuses Navbar/Footer from layout; the "FESTIVAL DROP LIST" email signup in the Figma node was deliberately deferred to 3c (it's a HubSpot form). Two-column desktop / stacked mobile, items table + Order Summary, all store-driven. Empty state LIVES HERE (the page is directly reachable via the drawer link and direct URL, unlike the drawer). The shared trust-badge block was extracted to `components/cart/TrustBadges.tsx` and imported by both drawer and cart page rather than duplicated.

**Phase 3c-1 — HubSpot seam + reusable WaitlistForm.** Decided custom-form → HubSpot Submission API, NOT HubSpot's embed script (the embed injects HubSpot markup that fights the dark/cyan design and blocks the in-place success state). Route handler `app/api/subscribe/route.ts` accepts `{ email, list }`, maps `list` → form ID server-side, POSTs to `api.hsforms.com/submissions/v3/integration/submit/{portal}/{formId}`. No API key needed — the Forms Submission API is public/keyless (same path the embed uses); the CRM API would need a token but we're not touching it. Form IDs live in env (server-only, no `NEXT_PUBLIC_`) with literal fallbacks; the orphaned `NEXT_PUBLIC_HUBSPOT_PORTAL_ID` was removed. `WaitlistForm` is one reusable component (`list`, `headline`, `copy`, `buttonLabel`, `source`) with an idle→submitting→success→error state machine, email-only, replace-in-place success. `semantic.error` (`#F56565`) added to `tokens.json` + `tailwind.config.ts` rather than borrowing CTA pink for errors. `WaitlistCard` reduced to a thin wrapper over `WaitlistForm`.

- **HubSpot IDs:** portal `244547358`, region `na2`, Gold form `d499701a-eb43-4c0e-a6cd-b56a57a98433`, General/$X-off form `2a41aa81-1b55-4bcd-97e5-b2b3fe23ee69`. (Offer amount $5 vs $10 still to reconcile in copy.)
- **reCAPTCHA 502:** first live submission returned 502 — the route faithfully reporting that HubSpot rejected the POST. Cause: reCAPTCHA was enabled on the HubSpot form, which blocks the custom-API path. Turned off in HubSpot; submission then succeeded and the contact landed in the CRM.
- **Spam protection (replacing reCAPTCHA):** since the submission endpoint is public, protection moves to our layer — honeypot field (silently 200s without forwarding if filled) + per-IP rate limit in the route. Cloudflare Turnstile deferred unless real abuse appears. Sized for dumb volume bots, not a targeted attack; no user friction.

**Still open from this stretch:** WaitlistForm border was specced to cyan-20% per the 2c Figma node — confirm it didn't inherit a drifted value. Offer-amount copy ($5 vs $10) unreconciled. Rate-limit durability (in-memory resets on cold start vs KV/Upstash) to confirm.

**Workflow note (recurring):** Bolt again reported it had updated working-memory.md when it hadn't (cf. beat #16). This entry was written manually. Bolt's self-reports describe intent, not action — the doc is maintained outside the builder.

**Story beats captured (Commerce Phases 2–3)**

| # | Beat | Tag |
|---|------|-----|
| 30 | "An infinite render loop in the cart-actions hook traced to a Zustand footgun: returning a fresh object literal from the selector. The store compares by reference, so a new object every render reads as a change, which triggers another render. The fix was to hand it stable identities — select each action individually, since they're defined once. The general lesson outlived the bug: when a system asks 'did this change?' by identity, wrapping your data in a new container each read is the same as lying to it." | `integration-depth` |
| 31 | "Built the cart in strict dependency order — data store first, verified in isolation with a throwaway harness, THEN the selection UI, THEN the drawer and page that read it. The discipline that paid off: the store's shape mirrors Shopify, so Phase 4 swaps the store's internals without touching a single component. Each surface that reads cart state (drawer, page, navbar badge) is just a view of one source — change a quantity anywhere and all three update because there's nothing to keep in sync." | `pm-discipline`, `integration-depth` |
| 32 | "Two surfaces that look identical needed different states. The cart drawer can never be empty — it only opens as a consequence of adding an item — so an empty state there is unreachable code. The cart page is a real destination reachable by URL, so it must handle empty. Built the states each surface can actually reach, not the states it superficially resembles." | `pm-discipline` |
| 33 | "Chose custom form → HubSpot's public Submission API over their drop-in embed. The embed would have rendered HubSpot's own markup inside our modal — wrong fonts, wrong colors, and no way to do the calm in-place success state. The tradeoff I accepted: the submission endpoint is public and keyless, so spam protection became my job (honeypot + rate-limit) instead of HubSpot's reCAPTCHA — which I'd had to disable anyway because it was silently 502-ing the API path. Brand control over the form was worth owning the spam layer." | `integration-depth`, `tool-choice` |

### Phase 4 — Shopify Integration + Reviews Provider (pending)

Storefront API client, typed responses, cart via Shopify Cart API (swap the local store's action bodies, not the component layer), checkout handoff via `checkoutUrl`, webhook handlers for inventory.

**Plus:** Reviews provider integration (whichever is chosen pre-Phase 2 per ADR-002).

---

### Phase 5 — Observability Instrumentation (pending)

PostHog + Vercel Analytics + Supabase mirror. Event taxonomy defined pre-launch. Success metrics document committed before traffic arrives. Age gate behavior + floating promo trigger logic finalized here based on event design.

---

### Phase 6 — Production Agent (pending)

n8n cron → data gathering → Claude API with tool schema → structured report → Slack + email. Agent *proposes* tests, never *runs* them.

---

### Phase 7 — Launch & First Loop (pending)

Soft launch. Two weeks of agent runs before trusting output.

- **Production agent:** The weekly automated analyst that proposes A/B tests from observed data.
- **Tool-per-phase:** The principle that no single tool owns the whole build.
- **Human-in-the-loop:** The agent proposes; the human approves and ships. Trust layer, not a bottleneck.
- **ADR:** Architecture Decision Record. A short markdown doc capturing context, decision, and consequences for a significant call.
- **Phase 1.5:** Mid-phase reconciliation between Phase 1 (design tokens + repo) and Phase 2 (Bolt scaffold), introduced because mobile UI and additional pages came in after Phase 1 close.
